# Welcome to the Awesome Bid System

This application was created to demonstrate some of the most popular data structures and algorithms in C++. In the included
CSV we have almost 18,000 entries for bids made on auctioned items for a municipal government. In this simple command line
application we use this list of bid entries to demonstrate methods for sorting, searching, and inserting data. Each method
includes a type of time keeping method to show how the data structures and algorithms compare. I have also included notes 
in the menu for Big O notation of each method.
